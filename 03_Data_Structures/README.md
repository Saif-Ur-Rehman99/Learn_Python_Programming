# Why data structures are important?

How can we measure the efficiency in programming?

There are two main measures for calculating efficiency in programming.
- Time: Time measures how long it takes to process the algorithm. (pagerank algorithm)
- Space: Space measures how much memory is used. (facbook lite and employee hiring example)

both are the main aspects that really matters in programming.

## Time

There are three methods for measuring the time complexity of programming
- Measuring time (but I won't be same on different hardware)
- Counting operations (but No clear definition of which operation to count)
- Order of growth (measure in terms of the size of input)

### Order of growth
There are only six cases in which order of growth can implemented
- Constant O(1)
- Logarithmic O(log)
- Linear O(n)
- Nlogn O(nlogn)
- Quadratic O(n^2)
- Exponential O(2^n)
